## Roblox Open Cloud API in Python

Roblox Open Cloud is an addition to the roblox developer workspace that allows automation of workflows to improve the efficiency of content creation and adds support for your needs to develop games on Roblox.

Open Cloud allows you to build your own tools and applications to access your roblox resources through web apis. Open Cloud is accessed through API keys or OAuth applications, and permissions can be set on api keys and authentications to determine the accessibility level of those authenticated applications and utilized api keys.

Additionally, webhooks can also be utilized to receive real-time notifications on third-party tools or custom endpoints.

## Installation

To install with pip, simply run the **one** of the following in a command prompt:

``pip install roblox-cloud-api``  
``pip3 install roblox-cloud-api``  

or if those do not work, **one** of the following;  

``py -m pip install roblox-cloud-api``  
``python -m pip install roblox-cloud-api``  
``py3 -m pip install roblox-cloud-api``  
``python3 -m pip install roblox-cloud-api``  

*covers the scenarios where the command prompt python keyword differs*
